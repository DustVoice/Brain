For easy file editing, I’m currently trying out [Helix](https://helix-editor.com), so editing is as simple as calling `hx` on the file.

I tried out Helix some time ago but didn't find the ecosystem that appealing at that point. As the project matured some more, I found myself drawn to it again.
It aims to be a no-nonsense approach to LSP and [[Tree-sitter]] integration, coming with sane defaults and batteries included out of the box.

## Install

### [[Homebrew]]

```sh
brew install helix
```

### [[Snap]]

> [!note]
> You can add the option `--edge`, to use the _latest/edge_ channel instead of the default _latest/stable_ one.

```sh
sudo snap install helix --classic
```

### [[Flatpak]]

```sh
sudo flatpak install flathub com.helix_editor.Helix
sudo flatpak run com.helix_editor.Helix
```

### #OS/Fedora

> [!caution]
> Unfortunately, the #OS/Fedora package seems to be out of date currently, or at least significantly lacking behind development.
> Also, the [[Rust]] install from source isn't as straightforward as some other packages, where you can simply invoke [[Cargo#binstall]].
> For these reasons, I recommend the [[Helix#Homebrew]] installation method, at least for now.

```sh
sudo dnf install helix
```

## Usage

> [!info]
> This section is heavily inspired and/or copied from the [official helix documentation](https://docs.helix-editor.com/registers.html).
> Therefore, please always refer to the upstream documentation.
> The only reason I replicate it is for easier referencing for myself, as a previous heavy [[Neovim]] user.
> I also highlight the rows differing significantly from normal VIM behaviour.

### Movement

> [!note]
> Unlike Vim, `f`, `F`, `t` and `T` are not confined to the current line.
